End Goal: Aimed to create a fully automated solution to turn on and off water pump based on overhead tank

Objective is to dive deep into each and every aspect and learn along the way while building the solution.
Emphasizing the <dive deep> here, the thought is to research every possible solution/component be it about programming involved if any, any hardware involved if any
